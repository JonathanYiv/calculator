## Pre-Project Thoughts

This should be fun.
I am coming into this with a much stronger understanding of the fundamentals of javascript.
I might experiment with some fancy CSS stuff.. maybe.

## Post-Project Thoughts

This was fun.
I used CSS Grid for the first time..wowee. That is some awesomely powerful stuff.
That positioning power is excellent.
This was some good JS practice as well.
